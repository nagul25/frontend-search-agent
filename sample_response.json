These are shown below with their TEB status and short notes.\n\n\n**Available Pub/Sub tools**\n\n- **Vertex AI** (TEB Status: TEB Approved) — AI/ML platform entry with Pub/Sub sub-capability and enterprise deployment guidance.\n- **Istio** (TEB Status: TEB Approved) — Service-mesh/monitoring tool listed under Pub/Sub for integration and governance patterns.\n- **Cohere Embed** (TEB Status: TEB Approved) — Analytics/embedding tool with Pub/Sub sub-capability (note: deprecated for new deployments per standards comments).\n- **Dataflow** (TEB Status: Deprecated) — Platform tooling listed under Pub/Sub but marked Deprecated; avoid new deployments.\n\n\n**Recommendation**\n\n- For production Pub/Sub needs prefer tools with TEB Approved status (Vertex AI, Istio, Cohere Embed) and avoid Deprecated entries (Dataflow) unless maintaining legacy systems.\n- Verify specific integration, networking and identity requirements (private endpoints, managed identities) in each tool’s EA notes before implementation.\n\n\n**Notes**\n\n- The list above is drawn directly from the Mahaaya context dataset.  Confirm final selection with the TEB and the capability manager for each tool before proceeding.",
